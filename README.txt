======================
 dataflake.docbuilder
======================
This package provides a set of scripts to automate building
Sphinx-based package documentation for packages hosted on a 
source code revision control server such as Subversion, 
Git or Mercurial. They will...

- check out the current development trunk and all tagged versions

- build all Sphinx-based documentation in them, if it exists

- stitch together the trunk and release versions in a single 
  HTML file to provide a simple jump-off page for all package 
  versions

- rebuild the Sphinx documentation if there were any changes 
  since the last build

Documentation
=============
Full documentation for the last released version is at
