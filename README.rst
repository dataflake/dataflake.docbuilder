======================
 dataflake.docbuilder
======================
This package provides a set of scripts to automate building
Sphinx-based package documentation for packages hosted on a 
source code revision control server such as Subversion, 
Git or Mercurial. They will...

  * check out the current development trunk and all tagged versions
  * build all Sphinx-based documentation in them, if it exists
  * stitch together the trunk and release versions in a single 
    HTML file to provide a simple jump-off page for all package 
    versions
  * rebuild the Sphinx documentation if there were any changes 
    since the last build
